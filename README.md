# Hello!
I am a programmer that codes in HTML, Java, CSS and Javascript.
I have been very busy latly because I have been developing my first custom Flipper Zero firmware. I also started making random stupid games, which I find very funny. 
If you want to talk to me you can chat on Discord. My Discord info is in the Social Media section.

If you have any questions about what I do, go to my Discord profile and send me a message.
If you are interested please check out my oficial website [HERE](https://finnsabia.com)
