# Hello!
I am a programmer that codes in HTML, Java, CSS and Javascript.
I have been very busy latly because I have been developing my first custom Flipper Zero firmware. I also started making random stupid games, which I find very funny. 
If you want to talk to me you can chat on Discord. My Discord info is in the Social Media section.
